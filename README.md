![UTSAV Festival](/banner/banner.jpeg)

> **Note**: This repository contains a modified version of the project that differs from my original implementation.

## Repository Status

This repository now contains a revised version of the project that has undergone significant design changes from my initial implementation. The original concept featured different artistic choices and technical approaches than what is currently represented here.

## Overview

UTSAV Arts Festival is an immersive web experience inspired by Frank Herbert's Dune universe, showcasing a fictional arts festival on the desert planet Arrakis. The project features elaborate animations, interactive elements, and a unique aesthetic that blends futuristic technology with mystical desert elements.


## Features

- **Animated Hero Section** - Dynamic entry animations with 3D pyramid scene and particle effects
- **House Selection System** - Interactive cards for each artistic house with unique visual identities
- **Event Showcase** - Animated event cards with flip effect for detailed information
- **Live Scoreboard** - Dynamic score counters and achievement displays for houses
- **Responsive Design** - Fully responsive layout across all device sizes
- **Advanced Animations** - Parallax effects, scroll-triggered animations, and particle systems

## Technology Stack

- **React** - Component-based UI architecture
- **GSAP** - Advanced animations and scroll effects
- **CSS Modules** - Scoped styling with modular approach
- **Three.js** (via PyramidScene) - 3D elements integration
- **Lucide React** - Lightweight icon library

## Design Philosophy

The design merges the mystical elements of Dune with Egyptian influences, creating a unique visual language that feels both ancient and futuristic. The color palette draws from desert landscapes, with accent colors representing the four houses.

The interface employs subtle parallax effects, sand particle animations, and glowing elements to create an immersive experience that transports users to the fictional world of Arrakis.

## My Journey

This project represents my best work so far in web development, where I pushed the boundaries of:

- Complex animation choreography using GSAP
- Scroll-triggered interactions and parallax effects
- Advanced CSS techniques for atmospheric effects
- Thoughtful component architecture in React
- Visual storytelling through interface design

The sand-like particle systems, animated decorative elements, and the cohesive visual language showcase my growth as a developer who can blend technical implementation with creative vision.
